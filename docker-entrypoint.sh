# Keeparr container entrypoint.
#
# Goals (in priority order):
#   1. The app must be able to write to /app/data, no matter how the bind
#      mount got created on the host.
#   2. Files written into /app/data should be owned by the host user that
#      ran `docker compose up`, so backups/inspection work without sudo.
#   3. The Node process should never run as root.
#
# How it works:
#   - The image starts as root (so we can chown).
#   - We figure out the desired UID/GID:
#       a) If PUID/PGID env vars are set explicitly, use them.
#       b) Otherwise, if /app/data exists and has a non-root owner already
#          (user pre-created it on the host), inherit that ownership so
#          host files stay owned by whoever made the directory.
#       c) Otherwise fall back to 1000:1000 (the default "node" user).
#   - chown /app/data recursively (cheap unless it's a huge dataset).
#   - Re-exec the original CMD as that UID via su-exec.
#
# Skip ownership fixing entirely with KEEPARR_SKIP_CHOWN=1 (e.g. on a giant
# data dir where you've already gotten the ownership right and the recursive
# chown is slow).
