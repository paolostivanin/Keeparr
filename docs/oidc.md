# OpenID Connect single sign-on

Keeparr can use one OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider as an additional sign-in method. This works with standards-based providers such as Authentik, Pocket ID, Google, Keycloak, and compatible self-hosted identity providers.

OIDC does not replace Keeparr's authorization model. A provider identity is linked to one Keeparr user, and that user retains their normal Keeparr role, note ownership, sharing permissions, and settings.

## Provider setup

Create an OIDC application in your identity provider and register this redirect URI:

```text
https://your-keeparr.example/api/auth/oidc/callback
```

Set the following environment variables, then restart Keeparr:

```text
BASE_URL=https://your-keeparr.example
KEEPARR_OIDC_ISSUER=https://identity.example
KEEPARR_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=keeparr
KEEPARR_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
KEEPARR_OIDC_NAME=Your provider name
```

`KEEPARR_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` is optional for public clients when the provider permits PKCE without a secret. The issuer must exactly match the `issuer` value in the provider's OIDC discovery document, including any trailing slash; it is not merely the provider's login page. Keeparr discovers the remaining provider metadata from that issuer.

The default scopes are `openid profile email`. Override them with `KEEPARR_OIDC_SCOPES` if your provider requires different scopes.

## Google

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create or select a project.
2. Configure **Google Auth Platform > Branding**.
3. Under **Audience**, choose **Internal** for a single Google Workspace organization or **External** for regular Google accounts. If an External app is still in testing, add each account that will test it as a test user.
4. Open **Clients**, create a client, and choose **Web application**.
5. Add this exact **Authorized redirect URI**:

   ```text
   https://your-keeparr.example/api/auth/oidc/callback
   ```

6. Copy the generated client ID and client secret into Keeparr:

   ```text
   BASE_URL=https://your-keeparr.example
   KEEPARR_OIDC_ISSUER=https://accounts.google.com
   KEEPARR_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com
   KEEPARR_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   KEEPARR_OIDC_NAME=Google
   ```

Keeparr uses Google's server-side authorization-code flow, so an Authorized JavaScript origin is not required for this integration. The redirect URI must match exactly, including its scheme, hostname, port, and path. See Google's [OpenID Connect documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect).

## Authentik

1. In the Authentik administration interface, open **Applications > Applications**.
2. Create an application named `Keeparr` and an associated **OAuth2/OpenID Provider**. The **Create with provider** flow can create both together.
3. Select a normal authorization flow and set the client type to **Confidential**.
4. Add this exact redirect URI using strict matching:

   ```text
   https://your-keeparr.example/api/auth/oidc/callback
   ```

5. Select a signing certificate so Authentik signs tokens asymmetrically, and make the `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scope mappings available.
6. Copy the provider's client ID and client secret.
7. Copy the issuer exactly as Authentik publishes it. With the recommended per-provider issuer mode and an application slug of `keeparr`, it normally looks like this:

   ```text
   BASE_URL=https://your-keeparr.example
   KEEPARR_OIDC_ISSUER=https://auth.example.com/application/o/keeparr/
   KEEPARR_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-authentik-client-id
   KEEPARR_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-authentik-client-secret
   KEEPARR_OIDC_NAME=Authentik
   ```

The trailing slash in Authentik's per-provider issuer is significant. If you use Authentik's global issuer mode, copy the `issuer` value from the application's discovery document rather than assuming the URL. Application policies and group bindings can restrict which Authentik users may connect Keeparr. See Authentik's [OAuth2/OpenID provider documentation](https://docs.goauthentik.io/add-secure-apps/providers/oauth2/).

## Pocket ID

1. Sign in to Pocket ID as an administrator.
2. Open **Settings > OIDC Clients** and select **Add OIDC Client**.
3. Name the client `Keeparr`.
4. Add this callback URL:

   ```text
   https://your-keeparr.example/api/auth/oidc/callback
   ```

5. Enable PKCE if that option is shown. Keep **Public Client** disabled when using the generated client secret.
6. Optionally limit access to selected Pocket ID groups.
7. Save the client and copy its client ID and client secret into Keeparr:

   ```text
   BASE_URL=https://your-keeparr.example
   KEEPARR_OIDC_ISSUER=https://id.example.com
   KEEPARR_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-pocket-id-client-id
   KEEPARR_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-pocket-id-client-secret
   KEEPARR_OIDC_NAME=Pocket ID
   ```

Pocket ID uses the instance URL as its issuer. Confirm the exact value by opening `https://id.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` and copying its `issuer` field. See Pocket ID's [OIDC client authentication documentation](https://pocket-id.org/docs/guides/oidc-client-authentication).

## Apply and verify

Recreate or restart Keeparr after changing its environment. With Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You can verify that the issuer publishes usable discovery metadata before connecting an account:

```bash
curl -s "${KEEPARR_OIDC_ISSUER%/}/.well-known/openid-configuration" | jq .issuer
```

Authentik's global issuer mode is an exception: its discovery document can remain under the application's `/application/o/<slug>/` path even when the published issuer is the instance root. Use the discovery URL shown by Authentik in that configuration.

## Connect a Keeparr account

Every user must first have a local Keeparr account. OIDC identities do not automatically create accounts and are not matched to accounts by email.

1. Sign in to Keeparr with your existing local account.
2. Open **Settings**, then **Security**.
3. Select **Connect SSO account** for the configured provider.
4. Complete the provider sign-in and consent flow.

Keeparr links the provider's stable issuer and subject identifiers to the signed-in Keeparr account. A provider identity cannot be linked to two Keeparr accounts. The user's local password remains available as a fallback and is required for account-management actions such as changing the password or deleting the account.

## Notes

- Keeparr supports one configured upstream OIDC provider per server.
- GitHub's standard OAuth service is not itself an OIDC provider. Use an OIDC-capable broker or identity provider in front of GitHub if GitHub should be the upstream login.
- Localhost HTTP issuers are accepted for development. Production issuers should use HTTPS.
